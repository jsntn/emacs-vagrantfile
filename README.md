# emacs-vagrantfile
An Emacs quick setup with Vagrant

This `Vagrantfile` is based on Arch Linux with Emacs 28.1.

Refer to `deploy/bootstrap.sh` for details.

Login credentials:
- root/root
- vagrant/vagrant

For the Windows PC users, I would recommend the Alacritty - A fast, cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator. My `alacrity.yml` is also shared in this repository.
